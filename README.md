This is the start of my personal website, located at [wfchang.space](wfchang.space) (with [wfchang.tech](wfchang.tech) as an alias). I'll use the website as a place to put my projects or links to my projects!

# Building
- Run local: `python -m http.server`

# Next Steps
- Project Melody stuff: figure out backend (see [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/hgtxpz/i_am_lost_while_trying_to_fullstack_develop_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) for fullstack web development help)
    - might need to create a backend, design a RESTful API
    - another [possibly helpful link](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8xdh5s/how_do_you_connect_the_frontend_and_backend/)
    - [a fullstack course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbZMNtaOXJQiDebNXjVapWPZ)
    - [another fullstack course, articles instead of videos](https://fullstackopen.com/en)
    - will probably need to do fuzzy searching in SQL, check [this](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/t-sql-programming/fuzzy-searches-sql-server/) or [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/921978/fuzzy-matching-using-t-sql) or [this](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/fuzzy-search) and/or [this?](https://www.got-it.ai/solutions/sqlquerychat/sql-help/data-query/sql-fuzzy-logic-matching-step-by-step-example-in-sql-server/)
