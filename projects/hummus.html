        Project Hummus will be an iOS app with a suite of features
        that helps anyone eating at USC dining halls have the best meal possible.
    </h1>
    <p>
        This idea is based on a prototype I created with three other team members
        during my first hackathon in Fall 2019 &mdash; TrojanHacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, the app will display the menus of the three dining halls at USC.
        This display will be improved over USC's menu display in several ways:
        it will show the foods in order of importance (entrees and main dishes
        before condiments, for example); and it will be customized to your food
        preferences, allergies, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Food preferences will be an important part of the app. You can get notified
        when a food you've favorited is on the menu. In the future, a machine learning
        algorithm could help you discover new dishes you'll enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, given these food preferences, the app can give a recommendation
        for which dining hall you'll enjoy eating at most based on how good you'll
        like the food there. This can also be improved with a future ML algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third, a community-type feature of rating entrees on a given day can give
        alerts to other users about, say abnormally good ramen at the USC Village or
        the pizza at Parkside. Simultaneously, over time, every entree at the
        dining halls will have an average rating for a more informed choice when you're
        about to go out for dinner!
    </p>
