        Jupiter will be a webapp that keeps track of all your achievements and
        helps you design both a resume and CV.
    </h1>
    <p>
        A resume can only contain the highlights of your achievements, skills,
        experiences, etc. while a CV should encapsulate all of these events.
        Jupiter will allow you to take all of these experiences and easily design
        both a resume and CV. The project is named after jupter notebooks, as each
        item on your resume/CV will act like a cell.
    </p>
    <pre class="highlighted subtitle">
    - Template designing
        - Easy drag-drop of experiences, like cells
        - easy category creation / organization
        - templates for an experience, skills section, etc.
        - Action verbs list built-in â€” as a list, or possibly also as suggestions
    - Simultaneous Resume and CV creation
        - So experiences are entered in one and the same (which will all show up in CV), then you choose which ones you want in resume
    - For now, just one font/color/accent designs but can expand later
